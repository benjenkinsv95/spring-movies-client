            navbar-text gives the same styling as the white links.
            mr-2 adds margin to the right of the message, so it isn't crammed into the links.

            This uses short circuiting:
            if user is false, no value on the right hand side of `&&` will ever make
            the `&&` evaluate to true. So it gives up, returns the falsy value, and
            shows nothing.

            If the user is true, then we have to evaluate the right hand side, to
            see if it is `true` or `false`. Since Jsx is truthy, we evaluate to it.

            This
            user && <span>Welcome, {user.email}</span>
            Same as:
            user ? <span>Welcome, {user.email}</span> : ''

            otherwise, show the signed out links (unauthenticatedOptions) */}
